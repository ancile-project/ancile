## System design <a name="design"></a>

Ancile is a framework that enables control over application's
data usage with privacy policies. We currently support Python and 
work with any OAuth service. Essentially, our system is a middleware 
between the data source (e.g. mail server, location data server, etc)
and some application created by the third-party.  

Our system allows the application to submit an arbitrary Python program that
requests data from the data source. Ancile upon getting this program fetches
the policy and access tokens associated with the user and the data source.
Ancile attempts to execute application's program in a restricted environment
enforcing the policies. If the program completes without policy violations the 
result of the program is returned back to the application.

**Use-based privacy** ([Birrell et al.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/UBP.avanance.pdf))
focuses on preventing harmful uses (**[NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html)**)
rather than restricting 
access to data. The application gets to use all necessary data for non-harmful
purposes. Each datapoint in Ancile has a policy that specifies what uses 
are permitted. Furthermore, this framework utilizes **reactive** approach meaning 
that after performing transformations on data policy will change. 

## Use Case <a name="usecase"></a>

1. **Company's data** -- data collected by the company's internal services such as
emails, location data, etc. Novel third-party applications propose new services
such as optimizing workplaces, person/room finders, depression/suicide preventions. 
However, these services require access to sensitive data, but usually given access
is too broad for the needs of the applications. For example, a service that
provides information on nearby available rooms does not need constant access to user
location data.  Unrestricted 
release of raw data can lead to malicious uses where the user 
location is accessed after hours or outside of the office. Ancile can 
address this problem by defining a policy on user's location data 
that shares data only at specific hours or at the specific location.
    
## Policy language <a name="policylang"></a>

Policies define an automata that changes on operations with data. For example, 
applying transformation that fuzzes the location can enable a bigger set of 
further operations on this data.

Our policy is defined as a regular expression over an alphabet of operations 
(Python commands) using the following operations:

1. **Sequence** -- `commandA . commandB` declares that the program has two call
`commandB` only after calling `commandB`. 
2. **Union** -- `commandA + commandB` either of both commands can be invoked.
3. **Intersection** -- `commandA & commandB` both commands need to match.
4. **Iteration** -- `commandA*` command can be repeated multiple times.
5. **Negation** -- `!commandA` can be any command except `commandA`.

We use **[Brzozowski derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative)**
approach that allows to advance the regular expression when calling a command.

## Installation

Here are the installation [Instructions](docs/source/installation.md).

We have a development environment running at https://dev.ancile.smalldata.io 
so please free to explore it. There are few tests accounts set up for exploration.
